Abstract:
                   Notice Boards are a common occurrence in variety of institutions which we come across on a daily basis. In the upcoming days, the notice/ advertisement boards are being managed manually. There is a long process involved in order to put up notices on the notice board. This wastes a lot of resources like paper, printer ink, man power and also brings about loss of time. 
In this project, we have proposed a system which will enable people to wirelessly transmit notices on a notice board using microcontroller. We can also make the system compatible with more than one wireless technology.
